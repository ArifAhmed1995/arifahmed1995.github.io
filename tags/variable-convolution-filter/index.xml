      <description>Here is a link to the paper.
I primarily did this project to implement an image processing algorithm from scratch. OpenCV does not have the implementation of Edge-Preserving filter for more than three channels when I did this project.
Independent Components Analysis(ICA) is first performed across the channels to separate out the information present in the image. Gaussian Filter is applied, this process is referred to as small structure removal in the algorithm.</description>
